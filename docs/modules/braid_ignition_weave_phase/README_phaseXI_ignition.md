# Phase XI – Charge Braid Ignition Weave

This phase encapsulates the final transition from harmonic modulation to ignition feedback. Here, the charge braid sustains its feedback loop via curl resonance memory, forming a self-refining ignition corridor across the primary axis.

## Purpose

- Encapsulate sustained ignition boundary braid  
- Refine modulation into self-generating field motion  
- Prepare energy corridor for Phase XII: Coil Stabilization

## Notes

- Mesh design mirrors peak-field toroidal twist at containment midline  
- Field derived from braid lockout between Phase X modulation and curl recursion
