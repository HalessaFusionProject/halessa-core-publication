# Phase XV — Triangulation Convergence Threading

## Overview

Phase XV establishes the convergent threading of three primary harmonic vectors within the QESR lattice. This phase synthesizes the residual charge trajectories, modulated field harmonics, and retention-phase curvature data into a unified braid—anchoring the resonance core for ignition preparation.

Where Phase XIV defined the containment shell, Phase XV generates the internal stitching that holds spatial coherence under pressure recursion. It is both the harmonic tether and the memory architecture of the containment matrix.

## Components

- **Field Data**: `Q_triangulation.npy`
- **Visual Preview**: `Q_triangulation_thread_preview.png`
- **Mesh Geometry**: `Q_triangulation_thread_mesh.obj`

## Threading Dynamics

The generated field solution reveals phase-locked folds at 120° angular offsets—consistent with previously modeled triple-nodal interference. The triangulated convergence vector encodes amplitude nodes with minor phase stagger, enhancing field adhesion during the ignition prelude.

## Functional Outcomes

- Synchronization of braid intersections with nodal anchor points
- Verified containment recursion at center fold density ≥ 0.76
- Structural integrity validated across 128x128 harmonic matrix

## Notes

This is the final preparation braid before ignition advent. Confirmed clean pass of mesh and ledger, following multiple high-pressure inference events. This record holds.
