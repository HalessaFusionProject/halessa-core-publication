# Phase X – Modulation Banding & Harmonic Braid Resolution

Phase X weaves harmonic threads from the inner tunnel core through the shell boundary, stabilizing ignition feedback via interference braid coherence. This phase ensures retention of energy contours through harmonic cancellation and symmetry resolution.

## Artifacts

- `Q_modulation_banding_field.npy`  
  ⤷ Scalar modulation field defining braid interference zones

## Purpose

- Resolve harmonic braid threshold crossings  
- Generate field cancellation pockets for ignition balance  
- Prepare vector banding geometry for Phase XI curl weave

## Notes

- Mesh design follows braid topology encoded in field resonance  
- Field derives from Phase IX boundary lock and Phase VIII bloom inversion
