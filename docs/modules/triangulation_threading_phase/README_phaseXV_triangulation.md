# Phase XV: Triangulation Threading

## Overview
Phase XV focuses on the triangulation threading process, a critical step in ensuring phase stability and coherence within the Halessa Framework. This phase aligns nodal convergence with harmonic field resonance, enabling distributed ignition and charge retention.

## Key Objectives
- Establish phase-locked triangulation threads.
- Validate nodal convergence under dynamic conditions.
- Preserve continuity across recursive field states.

## Methodology
1. **Triangulation Initialization**: Deploy harmonic containment fields to stabilize nodal points.
2. **Threading Execution**: Align phase vectors with resonance patterns to ensure coherence.
3. **Validation**: Use ledger entries and phase vectors to confirm stability.

## Outputs
- Triangulation threading logs.
- Phase XV ledger entries.
- Validation reports for nodal convergence.
