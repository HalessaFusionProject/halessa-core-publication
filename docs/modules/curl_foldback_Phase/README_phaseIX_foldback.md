# Phase IX – Curl Foldback & Ignition Sustain Threshold

This phase stabilizes the ignition zone by allowing previously divergent curl vectors to refold into a central retention shell. The structure serves both as a feedback harmonic dampener and a launch corridor anchor.

## Artifacts

- `Q_foldback_resonance_field.npy`  
  ⤷ Core retention field array describing inverse-curl reintegration  
  _Location_: `/data/fields/`

- `Q_foldback_resonance_preview.png`  
  ⤷ Visual field map of stabilized resonance  
  _Location_: `/docs/modules/curl_foldback_phase/`

- `QESR_foldback_retention.obj`  
  ⤷ Polygonal mesh modeling curl recursion shell  
  _Location_: `/prototypes/Nivalis_Node_Phase_I/modules/`

## Purpose

- Finalize axial ignition containment boundary  
- Redirect lateral harmonics into recursive loopback  
- Provide harmonic foundation for Phase X modulation banding

## Notes

- Mesh designed for Unity or Blender vector surface injection  
- Field origin derived from Phase VIII’s shell resonance peak-lock
