# Phase XIII: Quantum Confinement Lens

## Overview

This phase models the Quantum Confinement Lens (QCL), a parametric construct designed to focus harmonic energy fields into discrete quantized channels. It acts as a transitional resonant membrane, refining energy band granularity across field layers.

The QCL is the culmination of the ignition braid, resonance shell, and modulation cascade. It converges all prior phases into a coherent, temporally-aligned lensing function. This effect sustains core ignition harmonics during the sub-threshold containment oscillation band.

## Components

### 📁 Field Data

- `Q_confinement_lens_field.npy`:  
  A 2D array representing spatial energy density values across the confinement plane. This data is used to reconstruct intensity gradients in both preview plots and mesh geometry.

### 🖼 Preview Image

- `Q_confinement_lens_preview.png`:  
  A high-resolution 3D surface plot of the confinement lens, visualized as a folded harmonic well with symmetric pulse banding and null zone gradients.

### 🧩 Mesh Output

- `Q_confinement_lens_field.obj`:  
  The meshed representation of the lens intensity function. Exported at full resolution. Convergence axis aligns with Z; data is centered and scaled for downstream layering.

## Significance

This phase encodes boundary fidelity for internal ignition stability and temporal focusing. It prepares the system for nodal encapsulation and recursive inversion in Phase XIV.  

In the full ignition stack, the Quantum Confinement Lens ensures that modulation fidelity is not lost during sustained core resonance oscillations.
