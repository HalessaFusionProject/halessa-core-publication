# Tunnel Node Mapping Module

This module defines and initiates the harmonic threading of tunnel pinch points derived from the curl convergence across Q-field gradients.

## Purpose

To extract and visualize:
- Topological curl threading across latent harmonic tunnels
- Pressure trough convergence in Z-space
- Pinch zone identification (regions of highest compression index)

## Files

- `tunnel_node_threading.py`: Python module defining tunnel node extraction logic.
- `Q_Z_Pressure_Convergence_Trough.csv`: Z-axis slice summary of harmonic pressure.
- `Q_Resonance_Corridor_Curl.png`: Curl map guiding tunnel node detection.

## Output

- Vector list of tunnel node intersections
- Annotated 3D render (pending)
- Overlay export for Unity simulation merge

## Status

✅ Inputs loaded and verified  
⚠️ .obj mesh render pending backend pass  
🌀 Working logic being drafted in tunnel_node_threading.py
